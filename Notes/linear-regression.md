# Linear Regression
## Simple Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). <br>
More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x). <br>
**y = β0 + β1.x** <br>
<ul>
<li>y is the dependent variable i.e. the variable that needs to be estimated and predicted.</li>
<li>x is the dependent variable i.e. input variable</li>
<li>β0 is the intercept</li>
<li>β1 is the slope of x1</li>
</ul>

## Multivariate Linear Regression:
Similar to the simple linear regression model, but with multiple independent variables contributing to the dependent variable and hence multiple coefficients are to be determined. <br>
**y = β0 + β1.x1 + β2.x2 +….. + βn.xn** <br>
<ul>
<li>y is the dependent variable</li>
<li>x1,x2,...,xn are the dependent variables</li>
<li>β0 is the intercept</li>
<li>β1,β2,...,βn are the regression coefficients i.e. Slopes of x1,x2,...,xn</li>
</ul>

## Polynomial Regression:
Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression where we fit a polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the target variable and the independent variables. <br>
**y = β0 + β1.x1 + β2.x2^2 + β3.x3^3** <br>
<ul>
<li>y is the dependent variable</li>
<li>x1,x2^2,x3^3 are the dependent variables</li>
<li>β0 is the intercept</li>
<li>β1,β2,β3 are the regression coefficients i.e. Slopes of x1,x2,...,xn</li>
</ul>
